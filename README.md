# Automated Commit Testing & Deployment System

A fully automated system for fetching code from a remote system (backend.im), testing commits in isolated Kubernetes environments, and deploying successful builds to production.

## üìå Overview

This system integrates GitHub Actions, WebSockets, and Kubernetes to streamline CI/CD workflows:

1. **Code Push:** The system (acting as backend.im) pushes code to GitHub.
2. **Pipeline Trigger:** A GitHub Actions workflow triggers on every push to the `main` branch.
3. **Client Activation:** The workflow runs `client.py`, which communicates with the **orchestration app** running on port `8080` on an Ubuntu server.
4. **Test Execution:** The orchestration app deploys the test environment inside the `test-environment` namespace of the `backend-im` Kubernetes cluster.
5. **Feedback Loop:**
   - If **tests fail**, a commit message is generated to notify the system.
   - If **tests pass**, the code is deployed to production and a WebSocket message confirms the deployment.


‚öôÔ∏è Workflow Breakdown
- Step 1: Code Push & GitHub Actions Trigger
Code is pushed to the main branch.
GitHub Actions pipeline starts, running client.py.
- Step 2: Client Communicates with Orchestration App
client.py sends a WebSocket request to orchestration app running on port 8080.
The orchestration app starts a Kubernetes test pod.
- Step 3: Running Tests in Kubernetes
The orchestration app launches a test pod in the test-environment namespace.
The test pod clones the repository and runs tests.
Test results are sent back via WebSockets.
- Step 4: Deployment Decision
    - If tests fail, a commit message is created stating "Test failed".
    - If tests pass, the orchestration app:
Deploys the code to the prod-env namespace.
Sends a WebSocket message: "Production deployment successful".

üõ† Prerequisites
Kubernetes Cluster (backend-im cluster)
GitHub Actions configured
Ubuntu Server with WebSocket-enabled orchestration app running
Python 3.9+ and required dependencies.

üöÄ Quick Start

1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/backend-im-infra.git
cd backend-im-infra

2Ô∏è‚É£ Configure GitHub Actions
Add your Kubernetes cluster credentials to GitHub Secrets.
Ensure pipeline.yml is correctly configured for test execution.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Deploy the Orchestration App
Run the orchestration app on an Ubuntu server:
python scripts/orchestration_app.py

4Ô∏è‚É£ Push Code to GitHub
git add .
git commit -m "New feature"
git push origin main
This triggers the pipeline, which starts the testing process.
üî• Troubleshooting

1Ô∏è‚É£ Test Pod Crashing (CrashLoopBackOff)
kubectl logs <test-pod-name> -n test-environment
Ensure dependencies are installed correctly inside the pod.

2Ô∏è‚É£ WebSocket Connection Issues
curl -I http://localhost:8080/health
Verify the orchestration app is running on the correct port.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Deployment Not Happening
kubectl get pods -n prod-env
Check if production pods are running successfully.

üéØ Future Improvements
‚úÖ Automated rollback for failed production deployments.
‚úÖ Integration with monitoring tools like Prometheus/Grafana.
‚úÖ Support for additional backend frameworks.
